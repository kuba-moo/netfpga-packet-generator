HEAD -- Version X.X.X

Version 2.1.1
(11 Jun, 2010)
  Improvements:
    * Increase DMA performance (bigger buffers to prevent stalls)
    * SCONE builds correctly on more systems (removed dependence
      on /usr/lib/libnet.a)
    * Allow rkd to build under Ubuntu 10.04 (issue reported by gcarvajalb on
      the forums)

  Bug fixes:
    * Some register writes were missed when doing back-to-back writes
      (a buffer full signal was asserted too late)

Version 2.1.0
(28 May, 2010)

  Improvements:
   * Register system:
     - project name included in the #define at the top of the C header file,
       allowing the inclusion of multiple header files
     - device ID info (version, name, desc) now specified in project.xml
     - provide more information in headers at the top of generated files
     - output bitmasks in C/Perl
   * device_id module updated to include proj name, desc, and directory
   * nf2_info utility updated and installed by default (reads the device ID
     info from the active bitfile)
   * Moved contributed code out of lib/verilog/core
   * Added regression tests for the reference switch
   * Packaging scripts:
     - Verilog modules can be excluded
     - support added for git repositories
   * Selftest:
     - uses new register system
     - software verifies that the bitfile is downloaded before running the test
   * Types added for CPCI registers with bitmasks
   * Added functions to C common library:
     - read device ID register
     - verify that the correct bitfile is downloaded
   * Kernel module:
     - added basic ethtool support (Thanks to Kumar Sanghvi)
     - added mii-tool support (Thanks to Kumar Sanghvi)
     - support newer Linux kernels (net_device API deprecated)
       (Thanks to Paul Rodman & Maciej Å»enczykowski @ Google)
   * DRAM related:
     - DRAM block read/write test, DRAM queue test (1 queue), DRAM router 
       (8 queue) now released as full source code 
     - Several timing improvement to make the DRAM related modules faster 
   * Simulations:
     - verify that the correct number of register reads is performed
     - supports Xilinx ISim in addition to ModelSim and VCS
   * DMA:
     - added registers to nf2_dma and cpu_dma_queues
     - cleaned up DMA code
     - eliminated need for add_rm_hdr module

  Bug fixes:
   * numerous fixes to register system:
     - incorrectly output of instance block addresses
     - replace periods with underscores in identifier names
   * cpci_download:
     - should work correctly on Fedora systems
       (Thanks to Paul Rodman)
   * cleaned up logic in DMA -> reduction in timeout errors

  Other changes:
   * CPCI project renamed: CPCI_2.1 -> cpci
   * CPCI PERL library updated: CPCI_21Lib.pm -> CPCI_Lib.pm
   * Preparation for 10G system:
     - Perl NF2 library renamed to NF
     - nf2 replaced with nf in utility names (eg. nf_download)
     - NetFPGA directory renamed to netfpga (instead of NF2)

Version 1.2.5-1 beta
(22 Jan, 2009)

 Bug fixes
  * Replaced selftest bitfile to ensure it meets timing

Version 1.2.5 beta
(20 Jan, 2009)

 Bug fixes
  * MAC IO queues
    - Disabled MAC truncation of packets for ethertypes < 46 (not all modules are short-packet safe)

 Minor new features and improvements:
  * CPCI
   - Corrected bug preventing programming of Virtex via JTAG immediately after power-on

 Improvements:
  * Updated location information in UCF files for CPCI reprogramming signals
    (these are unused in all but the CPCI reprogrammer) -- eliminates warning
    about location constraints for signal pins


Version 1.2.3 beta
(21 Jul, 2008)

 Improvements:
  * Updated the reference NIC and reference router regression tests

  * Packaging
   - RPM packages released to improve installation process for CentOS users

  * Updated DMA engine
    - DMA transfers from host to NetFPGA use the dedicated DMA bus between Spartan and Virtex
    - Supports operation at both 125 MHz and 62.5 MHz (previous version only functioned at 125 MHz)


 Minor new features and improvements:
  * Kernel driver
    - Checks added to prevent ioctl access outside of NetFPGA address space
    - Checks added to prevent ioctl calls prior to complete card initialization (crashes seen on some CentOS 5 systems)
    - Register read/write functions exported to allow other kernel modules to use NetFPGA module
    - Added tx packet/byte counters (bug #4)
    - Kernel unloading/reloading fixed (bug #15 + unreported bug)

  * nf2_download
    - Verifies that the Virtex bitfile was compiled against the CPCI version currently loaded (bug #54)

  * cpci_reprogram
    - Added --bit option to specify the CPCI bitfile to download

  * Selftest
    - Updated to support new DMA code
    - Register addresses reassigned

  * Utilities

    - Added sram_dump tool (lib/scripts/sram_dump) to dump the contents of SRAM

  * Perl libraries
    - Libraries restructed slightly to allow use in other projects (external interfaces should remain unchanged)

  * Compatibility
    - Minor changes to improve compatibility with non-supported Linux distributions

  * Projects
    - Project specific C/Perl register defines will be built when a local Verilog register defines exists
