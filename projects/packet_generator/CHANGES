   * Allow 10kbps deviation from desired rate in rate limiter regression test


Version 1.1.0
(Apr 30, 2010)

  Improvements:
   * Supports loading of headers only into SRAM. Packets can be padded upon
     tranmission to a per-packet-specified length.
   * Received packets dropped by default on ports not being captured.
     (Necessary when transmitting and receiving at maximum data rate on all
     four ports to overcome limitation in output queues.)
   * Enable capturing without transmission.

  Bug fixes:
   * Fix usec calculation when run in nanoseconds mode
